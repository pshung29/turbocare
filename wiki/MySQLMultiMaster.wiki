For our production system at CIHSR we are using 3 MySQL 5 Servers.  

# *HIS1* - A Master MySQL server with turbocare running through Apache
# *HIS2* - A Master MySQL server with turbocare running through Apache
# *RPT1* - A Slave MySQL server with turbocare running just for reports through Apache. It also has the backup software running on it.
