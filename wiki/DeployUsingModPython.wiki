== Introduction ==

This is a quick guide to installing turbocare using mod_python on Ubuntu.  Using Apache to serve the static content makes things nice and fast.  This is very much designed as a step by step documenting one way of setting things up.  There are other ways to do most things in here.  

Commands are in _italics_.
==Procedure==
===Install mysql, turbocare, python, and apache2 packages.===
_sudo apt-get install gcc libc6-dev  build-essential_

_sudo apt-get install mysql-server python-reportlab mysql-admin subversion_

_sudo apt-get install python-pysqlite2 python-mysqldb python-imaging  python-dev python-setuptools_

_sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-python2.4_

===Install turbogears===

_sudo easy\_install -Z TurboGears_

_sudo easy\_install -Z SQLObject_  

Note you may need to specify v0.7 as 0.8 and 0.9 have caused me some troubles 

Note when using easy"_"install we need to specify the install as unziped eggs as this stops apache from trying to extract the eggs into its own home directory.

===Install turbocare===
_cd ~/_

_svn checkout http://turbocare.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ turbocare_

===Setup database===
We should add a password to MySQL's root user but I will add that later. 

_mysql -u root -p_

just press enter if you have no password yet.

at the prompt _create database turbocare_

press enter and then ctrl-D to exit. 


_cd ~/turbocare_

_python mysqlschema.py -d turbocare -u root -o schemaupdt -f turbocareschema.data_ 

_python mysqlschema.py -d turbocare -u root -o restore -f turbocarebackup.data_ 

===Check standalone turbocare===
_cp dev-sample.cfg dev.cfg_
_nano dev.cfg_

Check that all the variables are right. Particularly the sqlobject.dburi string.

_python start-turbocare.py_ 

If this loads without errors you have installed turbocare. Check it's really working by visiting http://localhost:8080/.  If it is congratulations your half way to having turbocare and mod_python installed.  Maybe you should grab a coffee.  

===Modpython time===
Now to get mod_python working 

_cd ~/turbocare_
_cp sample_prod.cfg prod.cfg_
_nano prod.cfg_

This is the production configuration file.  Make sure the database variable is right. You can also change the log file locations if you want to.

_sudo python setup.py install_

We need to install the files for apache to be able to find them.  Note after every update you need to run this command.


_sudo cp modpython_gateway.py /usr/lib/python2.4/site-pakages_

Copy Modpython Gateway to pythons sitepackages.  This lets us use TurboGears with mod_python. 


_sudo cp apache-turbocare.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/turbocare_

_sudo cp apache-ssl-turbocare.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/turbocare-ssl_
Copy Apache def files

_sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/turbocare_

Change any references to /home/david to the home/USER where user is the user in which you have done the installation with.

_sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/turbocare-ssl_

Change any references to /home/david to the home/USER where user is the user in which you have done the installation with.

_sudo a2enmod mod_python_

Enable mod_python for apache2

_sudo a2enmod  ssl_

Enable ssl for apache2

_sudo a2dissite default_

Disable the default site as we want turbocare to be new default.

_sudo a2ensite turbocare_

Enable turbocare site

_sudo a2ensite turbocare-ssl_

Enable ssl version of turbocare.

_sudo nano /etc/apache2/ports.conf_

Add a new line with ÒListen 443Ó 

_sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart_

Restart Apache2 to get it to load changes. 

Go to http://localhost and https://localhost in a webbrowser. Both should display first page of turbocare.  

==Upgrades==
To upgrade turbocare
_cd ~/turbocare_
_svn update_
_sudo python setup.py install_
_sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart_
